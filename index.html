                <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my website! I am currently a 3rd Year undergraduate student at Miami University - 
                    Oxford, OH pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, as well as a minor in philosophy and statistical methods. 
                    I am primarily interested in cybersecurity and am seeking to build a career in the field in the coming years. 
                    To this effect, I am currently searching for an internship position for the Summer of 2024;
                    I am open to exploring all career paths within the field as I still have a lot to learn and have no intention of confining myself to any one role. 
                    As I continue to broaden my cybersecurity and computer science skills, it is my goal to showcase and document my progress on this site.</p>
